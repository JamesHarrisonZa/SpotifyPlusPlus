# Spotify Plus Plus

Find maintaining playlists to be a chore ?

My goal was to be able to login to a spotify account.  
The user is able to view and filter their saved tracks based on [Spotify's audio-features](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/)

* Acousticness
* Danceability
* Energy
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Speechiness
* Valence

Then send the filtered tracks to their spotify client.

## ToDo:

* Rename TrackGrid.js
* More/better specs
* Styling tweaks
